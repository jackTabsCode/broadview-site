## [0.7.0](#0.7.0) (12/29/2021)

- Tool-related changes:
  - Added radar gun
  - Added pepper spray

    slot, unless it is an "extra", of which you can hold 6 of (for now)

  - BCSO/BCFR fleet manager: Did away with the "sign in, sign out" system, you can now spawn or despawn any car so long as it is not occupied, but it will show you who took out one that is spawned.
    - This was mostly done for simplicity reasons as well as compatibility with BCFRâ€”before, for example, if the spawner of an ambulance left, the ambulance would disappear, leaving the rest of the crew stranded. This will no longer happen as it is attached to the team itself, not the player.
- Very basic gun framework is in. The Colby .45 has been added and can be purchased at the gun store in Leesburg.

## [0.2.6](#0.2.6) (2/12/2021)

- Changes to interaction system UX
  - There are now three states to an interaction: Hidden, Disabled, and Enabled
  - Hidden does not show. Disabled shows faded and red. Enabled shows normally and can be used.
  - This adjustment was made in hopes that new players will understand that they don't have access to some things, rather than think they are broken. Some interactions will still remain hidden to reduce clutter.
