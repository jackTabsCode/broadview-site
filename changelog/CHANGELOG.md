# [0.6.0](#0.6.0) (8/11/2021)

- Converted most UI to Roact framework. Some changes as a result:
  - You cannot pick a spawn anymore. For now, you will be spawned randomly around the map unless you were on a team when you left
  - You can no longer despawn occupied cars
  - BCSO/BCFR fleet manager: Did away with the "sign in, sign out" system, you can now spawn or despawn any vehicle so long as it is not occupied, but it will show you who took out one that is spawned.
    - This was mostly done for simplicity reasons as well as compatibility with BCFRâ€”before, for example, if the spawner of an ambulance left, the ambulance would disappear, leaving the rest of the crew stranded. This will no longer happen as it is attached to the team itself, not the player.
- Very basic gun framework is in. The Colby .45 has been added and can be purchased at the gun store in Leesburg.
- Updated knife hit detection
- Made night slightly brighter - Still experimenting
- Different notification sound for money-related events
- Fixed bug where rain would appear during transition to rainy weather before the clouds actually appeared
- You can now fall of the map and die without having to rejoin

# [0.2.6](#0.2.6) (2/12/2021)

- Changes to interaction system UX
  - There are now three states to an interaction: Hidden, Disabled, and Enabled
  - Hidden does not show. Disabled shows faded and red. Enabled shows normally and can be used.
  - This adjustment was made in hopes that new players will understand that they don't have access to some things, rather than think they are broken. Some interactions will still remain hidden to reduce clutter.
