Data has also been reset

## [0.7.0](#0.7.0) (12/29/2021)

- Tool-related changes:
  - Added radar gun
  - Added pepper spray
  - Tools are now automatically equipped into a slot upon picking up. This means that you cannot pick up more tools that would fit in that
    slot, unless it is an "extra", of which you can hold 6 of (for now)
  - Some select tools and items now appear as visible accessories on the character, so you can tell if someone is armed for example. This also works with the toolbelts and holsters available in the game.
  - You can hold CTRL with a tool out in third person to look around
- UI-related changes:
  - Start menu converted to Roact with a new, fresh design that is a work in progress
  - Added a short intro logo sequence after you load in
  - Switched from Cmdr to Zircon for both commands and logging
  - Fixed bug where tool data would show when not equipped
- Misc:
  - Basic ammo box model added for item drops

## [0.6.0](#0.6.0) (10/20/2021)

- Converted most UI to Roact framework. Some changes as a result:
  - You can no longer despawn occupied cars
  - BCSO/BCFR fleet manager: Did away with the "sign in, sign out" system, you can now spawn or despawn any vehicle so long as it is not occupied, but it will show you who took out one that is spawned.
    - This was mostly done for simplicity reasons as well as compatibility with BCFRâ€”before, for example, if the spawner of an ambulance left, the ambulance would disappear, leaving the rest of the crew stranded. This will no longer happen as it is attached to the team itself, not the player.
- Very basic gun framework is in. The Colby .45 has been added and can be purchased at the gun store in Leesburg.
- Updated knife hit detection
- Made night slightly brighter - Still experimenting

## [0.2.6](#0.2.6) (2/12/2021)

- Changes to interaction system UX
  - There are now three states to an interaction: Hidden, Disabled, and Enabled
  - Hidden does not show. Disabled shows faded and red. Enabled shows normally and can be used.
  - This adjustment was made in hopes that new players will understand that they don't have access to some things, rather than think they are broken. Some interactions will still remain hidden to reduce clutter.
